# SPSCI2150: Applied Sports Science üìä
This is the online repository for `SPSCI2150: Applied Sports Science` (formerly `HRS2665: Applied Sports Science`), a graduate-level course in the Sports Science M.S. program at the University of Pittsburgh.

### General information üìã

The repository is structured based on weekly lectures, with R scripts, markdown and/or HTML files, de-identified data and, in some instances, PDFs of each lecture contained in a separate folder. Topics covered include:

- Force plates
- Force-velocity profiling
- Isometric strength testing
- Wearable tracking devices
- Visuomotor processing
- Match analysis (event-level tracking)

Going through each lecture, you will become proficient in the following: üí°

- Introduction to R
- Data cleanind and processing
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis (basic parametric and non-parametric testing)
- Exploratory data analysis
- APIs (HawkinR, CatapultR, Wyscout)
- Shiny

All scripts were written in `R Markdown` and require **at least** the following dependancies in order to run on your device: üìÅ
